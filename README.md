# Next.js
This is my first Next.js full-stack project based on a tutorial; a learning project.

In this project, one can sign up, sign in, and sign out. The home page shows all the posts that are being created.
If the user is signed in, they can create a post. If there is an existing post by a user, they can update or delete it.

You can find the video I used for learning and creating this project here: https://youtu.be/wm5gMKuwSYk
